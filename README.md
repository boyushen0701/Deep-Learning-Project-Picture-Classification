# Deep-Learning-Project-Picture-Classification

### Introduction:
Our motivation is to build a model to detect whether people are wearing facemask in the photo sothat we can help preventing the spread of COVID-19. The dataset consists of 7553 images divided into two folders by whether the person in the photo wear masks. We constructed five models using five different architectures of convolutional neural network, including ResNet34, AlexNet, LeNet5, VGG16, and all-convolutional
network. The results show that AlexNet and VGG16 are outperforming other models. The VGG16 model have the highest accuracy 94.17% though the runtime is very long. The AlexNet modelâ€™s accuracy is slightly lower than VGG16 but it runs much faster than VGG16.
